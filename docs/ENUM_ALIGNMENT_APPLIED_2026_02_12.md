## ENUM ALIGNMENT APPLIED — 2026-02-12

Timestamp: `2026-02-12T21:30:53.171Z`

### Changes (add-only)

### JobStatus

Reason: Admin calls GET /api/admin/jobs?status=COMPLETED; Postgres enum JobStatus did not accept COMPLETED, causing 500 (22P02 invalid input value for enum).

Applied SQL:

```sql
ALTER TYPE "8fold_test"."JobStatus" ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'COMPLETED';
```

Before:

```
DRAFT
PUBLISHED
ASSIGNED
IN_PROGRESS
CONTRACTOR_COMPLETED
CUSTOMER_APPROVED
CUSTOMER_REJECTED
COMPLETION_FLAGGED
COMPLETED_APPROVED
OPEN_FOR_ROUTING
```

After:

```
DRAFT
PUBLISHED
ASSIGNED
IN_PROGRESS
CONTRACTOR_COMPLETED
CUSTOMER_APPROVED
CUSTOMER_REJECTED
COMPLETION_FLAGGED
COMPLETED_APPROVED
OPEN_FOR_ROUTING
COMPLETED
```
