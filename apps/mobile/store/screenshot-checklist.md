## Screenshot checklist (store submission)

Order (recommended):
1) Job feed (approved jobs with the coordination fee visible)
2) Job detail (earnings + scope + “what happens next” + status)
3) Wallet (Pending / Available / Paid + manual payout request)
4) Trust & FAQ (manual oversight + no guaranteed income language)

Suggested captions (neutral):
- Job feed: “Browse approved service jobs.”
- Job detail: “Confirm routing. Operations completes the job.”
- Wallet: “Track pending, available, and paid totals.”
- Trust & FAQ: “Manual oversight and clear next steps.”

Copy hygiene:
- No income guarantees
- Avoid “make money fast”, “guaranteed”, “passive income”
- Mention manual oversight and manual payouts (v1)
